Instructions
--------------------
You are developing a web application to find the nearest place to eat. You've recorded the locations of all the restaurants in your area, and you can calculate your current location with GPS. Write a script to give you the name and coordinates of the nearest restaurant.

Functions you'll need
--------------------
Math.sqrt(number): Calculate the square root of number.
Math.pow(number, exponent): Raise number to the power of exponent.
print(message): [Nonstandard] Print message in the browser. I wrote it myself to make it simple to write to the screen without an obnoxious alert box.
